# AdventOfCode2020
My (python) scripts to solve the "Advent of code 2020" puzzles.
(https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

Do not expect beatiful, efficient or clean code, it is 'scratch' code to get answers to the puzzles, used icm with an interactive Python prompt. Variables names and comments might be in english, dutch of even frisian.
